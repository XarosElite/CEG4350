#These are the descriptions for commands in part 2 of HW1

                        --- Part1 ---
dup2 - This function is used to duplicate a file descriptor.

creat - when given a file path, it creates an empty file.

pipe - pipe's are a way for two processes to communicate through a 
half-duplex communication. Meaning the comminication is only one way 
between a parent and child. (Functionally it allows the output of one 
process to become the input to another one.)

fork - Fork creates a new process that is a duplicate of the one that
called it. It is now the 'child' process of the process that called 
it.

pthread_create - Creates a thread in the calling process.

system - Executes a chell command.

printf - Prints arguments to the stout but has arguments that allow 
you to format the output.


                        --- Part2 ---
In the file shell.cpp, the last line in the invokeCmd() function runs
the apropriate function from the cmdTable with the arguments, as long
as the needed simDisk and cfv exist and the args for the function are 
acceptable.
